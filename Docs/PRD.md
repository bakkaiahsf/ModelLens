. Vision & Goal

The AI Model Explorer Assistant helps junior developers and experts discover, understand, and experiment with Hugging Face models without requiring a database or external setup.
It should feel like a chat assistant combined with a model discovery tool:

Simple filtering of Hugging Face models.

Quick insights, use cases, and ready-to-use code snippets.

Context-aware chat for follow-ups.

üéØ Goal: Make it easy to find the right model quickly for MVPs, while learning best practices from a conversational assistant.

2. Core Features

Model Filtering (Dropdowns)

Dropdown #1: Model Type (text-generation, image-classification, speech-to-text, summarization, etc.).

Dropdown #2: Sort By (downloads, likes, trending).

Always fetch top 5 models per filter.

Model Result Presentation
For each of the 5 models:

Model name + provider.

Metadata (tags, downloads, likes).

Short use-case summary (plain English, 1‚Äì2 sentences).

Simple Python code snippet using pipeline or API.

Conversational AI Assistant

Users can ask follow-up questions about a model.

Assistant provides explanations in plain English.

Context maintained: remembers last model type & filter.

Integration with Hugging Face API

Query Hugging Face‚Äôs /models endpoint.

Restrict results based on selected type.

Sort results (downloads, likes, trending).

No Database Requirement

Use in-memory state/session to store context.

Keep everything lightweight for MVP.

3. User Workflow

User visits app ‚Üí sees a chat-like interface.

User selects Model Type from dropdown.

User selects Sort By criteria.

System fetches models ‚Üí shows top 5 models with summaries + code snippets.

User asks follow-up (e.g., ‚ÄúWhich one is best for summarizing legal documents?‚Äù).

Assistant explains using context ‚Üí responds in structured, simple language.

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Frontend (Next.js / React)

Chat-style UI for results and follow-ups.

Dropdowns for Model Type + Sort By.

Display results in a structured card format:

Title: Model name.

Subtitle: Provider.

Metadata row (downloads, likes).

Short summary.

Expandable panel for code snippet.

4.2 Backend (Node.js / Next.js API routes)

API route to fetch models from Hugging Face.

Accepts query params: model_type, sort_by.

Processes and formats into JSON with required fields.

Maintains session state in memory (store last user selection).

4.3 Hugging Face API Integration

Endpoint: https://huggingface.co/api/models

Query params:

pipeline_tag (e.g., text-generation).

Sorting logic (downloads, likes).

Response normalization for UI.

4.4 AI Assistant Logic

System prompt (the one we crafted earlier).

Runs on OpenAI/Anthropic/GPT backend.

Uses retrieved Hugging Face data as source of truth.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Response < 2s per query.

Scalability: Handle up to 500 concurrent users (serverless preferred).

Usability: Must be beginner-friendly (no jargon).

Reliability: Only display verified Hugging Face models.

No Hallucination: Assistant must not invent models.

6. Milestones & Task Breakdown
Phase 1: Foundations

 Setup Next.js project (frontend + API routes).

 Integrate Hugging Face API fetch function.

 Create dropdown filters (model type, sort by).

Phase 2: Model Display

 Design model card component (name, provider, metadata).

 Add expandable code snippet section.

 Implement top 5 sorting logic.

Phase 3: AI Assistant

 Define system prompt.

 Connect to OpenAI/GPT backend.

 Implement context memory (store last filter + models).

 Handle follow-up queries.

Phase 4: UX & Polish

 Add chat UI for smooth interaction.

 Add loading states & error handling.

 Write minimal docs / onboarding instructions.
